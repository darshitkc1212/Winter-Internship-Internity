These are a few key takeaways that one could deduce after going through the videos and blog posts:

#### Importance of Being Coachable
Coachability is not a technical skill or an inherent ability. It is mental attitude. It is defined by your ability to be coached. It is determined by your emotional ability to withstand the necessary constructive criticism and pressure from your coach. It requires you to do so without losing your positive spirit and without slackening in your motivation and effort. It is also defined by your ability to adapt and to improve as required.

#### Being Passionate
Passion is the energy that keeps us going, that keeps us filled with meaning, and happiness, and excitement, and anticipation. Passion is a powerful force in accomplishing anything you set your mind to, and in experiencing work and life the fullest extent possible. Hence, it is extremely important to be passionate in all phases of life and work.

#### Time Management
- It helps you achieve what you want, and faster - to get more done, but in less time.
- It helps you waste less time, and avoid more friction and problems.
- It helps you clear your schedule for more leisure time, and feel more energized.
- It helps you fulfill more tasks in less time, and in turn, feel more fulfilled.
- It helps you feel calmer and less stressed over time and make a change in your lifestyle for the better.

Also, coming to the Agile Methodology/Practices employed in the internship, I'm pretty excited to see for myself how theoretical concepts taught in Software Engineering are actually put to practice in industry via Trello, Slack etc, which I'd be using for the very first time!
